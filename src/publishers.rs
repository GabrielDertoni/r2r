// The publish function is thread safe. ROS2 docs state:
// =============
//
// This function is thread safe so long as access to both the
// publisher and the" `ros_message` is synchronized."  That means that
// calling rcl_publish() from multiple threads is allowed, but"
// calling rcl_publish() at the same time as non-thread safe
// publisher" functions is not, e.g. calling rcl_publish() and
// rcl_publisher_fini()" concurrently is not allowed."  Before calling
// rcl_publish() the message can change and after calling"
// rcl_publish() the message can change, but it cannot be changed
// during the" publish call."  The same `ros_message`, however, can be
// passed to multiple calls of" rcl_publish() simultaneously, even if
// the publishers differ."  The `ros_message` is unmodified by
// rcl_publish()."
//
// TODO: I guess there is a potential error source in destructuring
// while calling publish. I don't think its worth to protect with a
// mutex/rwlock for this though...
//
// Methods that mutate need to called from the thread owning the Node.
// I don't think we can count on Node being generally thread-safe.
// So keep pub/sub management and polling contained to one thread
// and send out publishers.
